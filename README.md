# extendable-enums-helpers
Helper methods for [extendable-enums](https://github.com/Rafaeltheraven/extendable-enums). Exists because I can't just EXPORT REGULAR FUNCTIONS IN A PROC-MACRO PACKAGE.

Methods in here are really for internal use. Ideally, these would be in an internal package for `extendable-enums`, but as hard as I tried I have found no way to export these methods properly. Until the rust compiler stops being annoying, we'll be stuck with this structure.
